# evmdasm
*A lightweight ethereum evm bytecode instruction registry, disassembler and evmcode manipulation library.*

This library is meant for providing a static interface and registry for EVM opcodes and instructions. The idea is to keep it as lightweight as possible especially when it comes to dependencies or high level features.

**This is a fork of the project [evmdasm](https://github.com/tintinweb/evmdasm).** 

The purpose of this fork is to create an up-to-date version of the disassembler.

This version is updated to the Shangai upgrade of the Ethereum Virtual Machine of mid 2023 (the list of opcodes is available [here](https://www.evm.codes/?fork=shanghai).)
